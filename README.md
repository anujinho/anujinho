- 👋 Hi, I’m @anujinho
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the concept of intelligence by embedding it in machines using mathematics and compute. 
     More specifically, my research interests include building Causally and Socially aware Agents, Generative Modelling, Self-Supervised Representation Learning and Meta Learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as a PhD candidate at TU Delft.
- 🌱 Previously worked as an AI Research Scientist at Shell and a Guest Researcher at TU Delft.
